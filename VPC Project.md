"Secure Network Architecture in AWS: VPC with Bastion Server, Internet Gateway, and NAT Gateway" 

AWS project "Secure Network Architecture in AWS" displays a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) infrastructure with a detailed design. For controlled data flow, it seamlessly connects NAT and Internet gateways, assuring the highest levels of security and performance. The gateway to private EC2 instances is a bastion server, which permits permitted access. This well-designed configuration provides a secure, scalable, and effective network environment to enable seamless communication between public and private resources in the cloud.
